# Minitaurus

PHP mini framework for versions of PHP >= 5.3

To run framework, you need to have PHP installed on the system. Place whole project code to any directory able to run `index.php` file.

Environment setting examples are in directory `Environments`.

This project is minimal PHP code to support debugging, templates and basic MVC structure for **showcase** examples. There should not be any dependencies on outside libraries, usually stored in `vendor` directory.
